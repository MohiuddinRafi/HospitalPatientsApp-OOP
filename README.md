# HospitalPatientsApp-OOP
Hospital Management System Project Overview This project is a Java-based Hospital Management System application designed to assist in managing patient records, employee information, and hospital stock for a small hospital run by the United Nations in an isolated community. The application supports object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, features a dynamic Swing-based GUI, and uses file handling to persist data.

The system is collaboratively developed by three team members, with each member responsible for a distinct section of the application:

Patients Module: Managed by [Mohiuddin Khan Rafi]
Employees Module: Managed by [Peter Burke] 
Hospital Stock Module: Managed by [David Clusker] 
Features Patients Module (my Contribution) Concepts Used:

Object-Oriented Programming: Instantiable classes, inheritance, and polymorphism to model patient information and behaviours.
Data Structures: Used ArrayList to store and manage patient records dynamically.
File Handling: Implemented serialization for saving and loading patient data. 
GUI: Built an intuitive user interface using Java Swing and JFrame.

Key Functionalities:
Add new patients with details such as name, age, and medical condition. View a list of registered patients. Remove patients based on their unique PPSN (Personal Public Service Number)â€”persistent data storage using serialized files.

Technologies Used Programming Language:
Java Development 
Tools: Apache NetBeans IDE 
GUI Framework: Swing 
Data Storage: File handling using Java serialization

Usage Launch the application.
Navigate to the Patients Module from the Menu Page to manage patient records.
